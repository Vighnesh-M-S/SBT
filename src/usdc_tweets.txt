RT @Rushdaverroes: We survived it all:
â€¢ FTX collapse
â€¢ LUNA &amp; UST implosion
â€¢ 3AC liquidation
â€¢ Celsius bankruptcy
â€¢ BlockFi shutdown
â€¢ USâ€¦
@USDC Wen another depeg? i want to buy at $0.6
RT @Ashcryptoreal: If you have survived 

- FTX
- LUNA
- UST
- 3AC
- Celsius
- BlockFi
- USDC depeg
- Banks collapsing 
- Binance Bank runâ€¦
The real insight:
Market conditions aren't constant. Black swan events happen.

1. Terra collapse
2. USDC depeg
3. Regulatory shocks

Your pool parameters MUST adapt, or you're just exit liquidity for smart money.
@Cyphertux Comme Ã  chaque bear market on a le droit Ã  une histoire chelou pour enclencher le dÃ©but du bear ( depeg usdc, luna, ftx etcâ€¦), je pense quâ€™on a le prochain narratif pÃ©joratif qui va dÃ©clencher tout sa ðŸ¥¶
The first major test came in March 2024: 
USDC depeg event causing market panic. 
My old setup would have been liquidated again. 
New system: Automatically reduced risk 30 minutes before the crash.
RT @AzosFinance: Centralized stable coins are not just dormant, they're opaque too. 

$USDC could depeg tomorrow and you wouldn't know why.â€¦

@monikaffm @LewiczMichal Mi zostaÅ‚o 100 Lun na wallecie. 
A UST teÅ¼ sprzedaÅ‚em ze stratÄ… 50%
Gdy zaczynaÅ‚ siÄ™ depeg chciaÅ‚em zmieniÄ‡ na USDC ale pamiÄ™tam tweeta  Don Kwona "
Stedy lads developing more capital "ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜‚
I tyle z tego zostaÅ‚o ðŸ˜‚
